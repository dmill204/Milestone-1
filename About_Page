        <p>I am a dedicated and focused student at Kennesaw State University. Currently I am focusing on perusing my bachelorâ€™s degree in information technology with a concertation in data analytics. My hobbies include hiking, swimming, and exploring the outdoors, I also enjoy playing racing games and chess. My favorite sport is soccer, and I got into soccer by watching Cristiano Ronaldo play for Real Madrid back when I was in sixth grade. Fun fact about me is that I can speak in four different languages and read and write in three of them. </p>
